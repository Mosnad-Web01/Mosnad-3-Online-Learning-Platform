# System Overview

This project is designed to support user authentication and data management with integration to a database named **`your_database_name`**. The system currently includes the following features:

- User authentication with separate login and signup pages.
- A customizable dashboard for authenticated users.
- Database integration for user and data management.

**Note:** At this stage, the pages are not yet connected to the database, and the backend logic is still under development.

## Current Features

- Migration files added to set up the database schema.
- Login and signup pages implemented, ready for user authentication.
- Dashboard page added to provide an overview of user data.

**Note:** At this stage, the pages are not yet connected to the database, and the backend logic is still under development.

## Key Features of the System

- Secure Authentication System.
- Database Migrations for maintaining the database structure.
- Session Management for user sessions.
- A data management dashboard.
- Real-time feedback on user actions.

## Setting Up the Database

To set up the database:

1. Update the database configuration file with your database credentials:

    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```

2. Run the following command to migrate the database:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

## Running the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project after cloning it:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
   First, clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

### 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   After cloning, navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your_project_name
   ```

### 3. **Install Dependencies Using Composer**
   Make sure you have Composer installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

### 4. **Set Up the `.env` File**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then, open the `.env` file and update the database connection settings with your credentials:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

### 5. **Generate the Application Key**
   Laravel requires an application key for encryption. To generate it, run the following command:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

### 6. **Run Database Migrations**
   Once the `.env` file is set up, run the migrations to create the necessary tables in the database:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

### 7. **Install NPM Packages (if applicable)**
   If the project uses frontend assets, install the required NPM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you need to compile assets, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 8. **Start the Laravel Development Server**
   You can now start the Laravel development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The server will usually be available at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### 9. **Test the Project**
   Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to make sure everything is running properly.

## Database Integration Status

- **Login and Signup Pages:** These pages are designed and ready for user input, but the logic to interact with the database is not yet implemented.
- **Dashboard Page:** The dashboard is designed to display user data, but it will show placeholder content until the backend is connected to the database.
